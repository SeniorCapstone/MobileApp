# MobileApp

-JavaFiles contains all of the java files that were used in the app.

-XMLFiles contains the xml files that were used.

-TestApplication.zip has all of the java and xml files. It also contains other files that are neccesary for the program to run.

-This app is in its very early stages. We will have to make a lot of changes in the code for our project.

-All of the changes we make in a file can be uploaded to one of the associated folders.

-Any new files we make could also be uploaded to the associated folder. Just so we are more organized.
